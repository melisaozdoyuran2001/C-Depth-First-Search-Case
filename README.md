# C#-Depth-First-Search-Case ðŸ‘¾ 

Objective: Create an interactive  nÃ—n grid, pre-filled with a percentage given by the user, where the user can click on cells to mark them with a red "X". When three adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, not diagonally) are marked, they should disappear.

## Features:

Grid Creation: Generate a square grid of size nÃ—n pre-filled with X's based on user input.

Marking Cells: When a user clicks on a cell, it should display a blue "X".

Clearing Cells: If three adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, not diagonally) are marked with "X", they should be cleared.

Reusability of Cells: Once cells are cleared, they should be clickable again, allowing users to mark them with "X".

Responsive Design: Regardless of the grid size, it should fit the viewport.
